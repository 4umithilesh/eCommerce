This project was generated with the [Angular Full-Stack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) version 3.2.0.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node ^4.2.3, npm ^2.14.7
- [Bower](bower.io) (`npm install --global bower`)
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (`npm install --global grunt-cli`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - Keep a running daemon with `mongod`

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `bower install` to install front-end dependencies.

3. Run `mongod` in a separate shell to keep an instance of the MongoDB Daemon running

4. Run `grunt serve` to start the development server. It should automatically open the client in your browser when ready.

## Build & development

## Testing

Running `npm test` will run the unit tests with karma.

# E-commerce portfolio project

This is a portfolio project built on Node.js and deployed to Heroku. Why? Because Docker is awesome and Heroku is free! Azure and AWS pay attention. Your model is not affordable for the little guys.

## Under the covers

I'm using this project as a testing ground for login, authentication, shopping cart, etc. I may add a chat functionality just to get some web sockets in there. For my day job, I am a team of one and miss getting feedback and working on a team. I don't want my growth to be stifled by my own myopia, so please comment if you should find the time. I love code reviews and would appreciate any feedback. 

### Design
I am NOT a designer, but I appreciate great design. For this project I started with a template by @avriqq
