# E-commerce portfolio project

This is a portfolio project built on Node.js and deployed to Heroku. Why? Because Docker is awesome and Heroku is free! Azure and AWS pay attention. Your model is not affordable for the little guys.

## Under the covers

I'm using this project as a testing ground for login, authentication, shopping cart, etc. I may add a chat functionality just to get some web sockets in there. For my day job, I am a team of one and miss getting feedback and working on a team. I don't want my growth to be stifled by my own myopia, so please comment if you should find the time. I love code reviews and would appreciate any feedback. 

### Design
I am NOT a designer, but I appreciate great design. For this project I started with a template by @avriqq
